  <p class="intro">Hi there! My name is Jeriah and as you can probably already tell I'm an aspiring web developer. Looking back I can remember in my high school years still not truly knowing what I wanted to do or pursue as a career, still looking. But I also knew I wasn't going to rush into somthing I would regret later because this would be the biggest decision of my life thus far. I always loved technology and I remember coming across something about Web Design and went to look a little more into it. Not long after doing some specific research about web development I knew this is what I wanted to do. My only decision then was to plan out how to learn. I knew I didn't really have the time to go to college and work my full time job but I was willing to give up my job and fully dedicate myself to web development but that's when I ran across Team TreeHouse. After trying the free trial that's what I went with. And that was back in late 2015, that turned out to be a great decision. And I can honestly say that I enjoy web development/programming more and more each day I'm always wanting to learn more. I think the thing I like most about all of this is that it's more of an art and skill that needs to be honed, which I relate to golf. I can definitely see myself doing this for the rest of my life!</p>

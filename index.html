  <p class="intro">Hi there! My name is Jeriah and as you can probably already tell I'm an aspiring web developer. I can remember back in high school still not truly knowing what I wanted to do or pursue as a career. But I also knew I wasn't going to rush researching and "soul-searching" because this is and will be the biggest decision of my life at the time. I always loved technology and I remember coming across something about Web Design at the time and went to look a little deeper. Not long after doing some specific research about web development I knew this is what I wanted to do. My only decision then was to plan out how to learn. I knew I didn't really want to go to college and spend thousands of dollars and spend 3-4 years finishing a degree. That's when I ran across Team Treehouse and after trying the free trial that's what I went with. And that was back in Janurary. And I can honestly say that I enjoy web development more and more each day I always want to learn more, but at the same time I don't want to rush and not get the fundamentals down solid in any language or framework I learn.</p>
